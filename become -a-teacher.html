                    <h1 class="mb-3">1. Earn an Undergraduate Degree</h1>
                    <p>If you fall into the category of individuals who know they want to be teachers by the time they enter college, it is a viable option to pursue an undergraduate degree in education. In fact, all states do require K-12 public school teachers to have at least a bachelor’s degree, specifically in elementary education for kindergarten and elementary school teachers.

                        Requirements for the type of undergraduate degree you hold vary from school system to school system. Some require K-6 teachers to major in a content area, such as social science or math. It’s also common for high schools to prefer that their teachers have earned a degree in a particular subject area rather than an education degree.
                        
                        If you do pursue an undergraduate degree in something other than education and come to find that a degree in education is required of you, there are other options available. A common alternate path is pursuing a higher education graduate degree that will provide you with the knowledge and skill set to successfully take a state licensure exam. Thus, the undergraduate degree you earn will not be an impedim.</p><br>
                        <h1 class="mb-3">2. Gain Teaching Experience </h1>
                        <p>          
                            Equally as important as an undergraduate degree is having hands-on experience in the classroom. This is the part of becoming a teacher that would prove to be tricky if you earn a degree in a field other than education; however, it is not impossible.
                            
                            Teachers must have a certain number of hours supervising in an educational environment to take the exam to earn a teaching license. This can be done during undergraduate studies, through an internship at a school, or during the time between graduation and starting full-time employment.
                            
                            American University requires students in both the on-campus and online MAT programs to obtain over 600 hours of hands-on classroom experience to graduate. We work closely with online students to find collaborative student-teaching experiences in partnership with high-quality teachers in locations near their homes.</p>
                            <h1 class="mb-3">3. Obtain Teaching Certification or Licensure </h1>
                                          
                           <P> Along with completing the required steps to becoming a teacher, public school teachers must obtain licensure or become certified. Certification follows grade level, with separate licenses for preschool through third grade, first grade through sixth (or first through eighth), and seventh grade through 12th.
                            
                            Certification and licensure regulations vary from state to state, so it is crucial that prospective teachers look into their respective states’ specific rules. Most states require teachers to successfully pass a general teaching certification test, in addition to tests in the individual subjects that they are interested in teaching.
                            
                            All states offer alternative routes to certification for prospective teachers who hold a bachelor’s degree but lack the education courses necessary for immediate certification. These alternative programs often allow candidates to begin teaching immediately under the supervision of an experienced teacher. Candidates are awarded full certification upon completion of the alternative program.
                            
                            It is important to note that private school teachers are not required to be licensed by the state. However, many private schools mandate that their teachers hold valid state certification. It is generally recommended that all teachers obtain the appropriate license or certification of their respective states so that they will not be limited in their employment options.</P>
                            <h1 class="mb-3">4.  Continuing Education for Teachers </h1>
                                        
                            While a master’s degree is not necessary in most places to become a teacher, a postsecondary degree brings major benefits no matter where you are or what you want to teach.
                            
                            Essentially all public school teachers are asked to complete a minimum number of continuing education or professional development course hours in order to maintain their state licenses.
                            
                            Many public schools do encourage their teachers to earn a master’s degree, which can make it a productive step to becoming a teacher.<br> This also provides the opportunity to be eligible for higher salaries, greater job flexibility, and a career projection into administrative positions.
                            
                            Once you’ve decided to earn your master’s in teaching, you need to prepare for the application process. Applicants to AU must take the Praxis Core exams and show that they have earned a satisfactory score or better. Each applicant must also submit a statement of purpose, two letters of recommendation, and a résumé.
                            
                            Earning a Master of Arts in Teaching
                            American University offers a Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT) degree, both on-campus and online, for students with no background or preparation in education who intend to earn licensure in elementary education (grades 1-6).
                            
                            <br> completing AU’s MAT program, you will be eligible for licensure. It is important to note that granting teaching licenses is a state responsibility as opposed to a process offered by any university. AU’s MAT program is approved through the District of Columbia, which encourages the earning of your licensure there. This process involves passing the Praxis Core and Praxis II and completing an application that includes a background check.
                            
                            One of the many benefits of completing AU’s MAT program is the access to the National Association of State Directors of Teacher Education and Certification (NASDTEC). <br>This is due to a partnership and reciprocity agreement with the city of Washington, DC. If you plan to pursue licensure to teach outside of DC, your certification earned from the AU MAT program can allow you reciprocal certification in over 40 states.
                            
                            Another way to pursue professional development in teaching is to obtain National Board Certification, a voluntary and advanced teaching credential. To earn this status, teachers must complete a rigorous peer-reviewed certification process that includes submitting videos of their teaching and student work samples, as well as passing a three-hour exam.
                            
                            Obtaining a Doctoral Degree
                            A doctoral degree is a good choice for those who desire to enter the highest administrative levels of education, such as by becoming a superintendent of a school or a professor of higher education or another subject area. The degree could also support an educational goal for students wanting to pursue research, curriculum development, or high-level governmental positions.
                            
                            Students who take doctoral courses can expect to learn about the newest research and studies in education.<br> It is the highest level of in-depth learning, providing students with a skill set that will help them pursue new responsibilities. Quality control, research analysis, strategic planning, assessment techniques, and data management are some of the many skills that a doctoral degree in education will provide.
                            
                            Timeline for Becoming a Teacher
                            Generally speaking, it takes an individual about four to five years to become a teacher. This timeline represents the time required to complete the minimum qualification for the teaching profession at an elementary, middle school, or high school level. 
                            
                            Depending on the level and type of career they want, teachers should also prepare for additional years of study if they plan to earn an advanced degree, such as an MAT or a doctorate degree in education.<br> The doctoral degree takes several years to obtain, as opposed to a master’s degree, which takes up to three years. The time to complete a doctorate in education can also depend on how long the student takes to complete their dissertation, or research project, which the student must also defend before a panel.
                            
                            Choosing Your Teaching Degree Program
                            Before you take the steps to become a teacher, you should consider several elements when selecting a program. The first element is to make sure a program is accredited, as accreditation provides proof that a college or university can sufficiently prepare students for their chosen field. <br>A degree from an unaccredited institution could negatively impact your career.
                            
                            Another factor to consider is a program’s course curriculum. While all programs will cover foundational concepts associated with teaching, some programs may offer more robust course options geared toward a teaching specialty that is particularly relevant to your interests.
                            
                            Other elements to consider when looking for a teaching degree are driven by personal choice or preference. These can include cost, class size, flexibility, and online versus in-person instruction.</p>
